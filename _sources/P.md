## Passenger Flow
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Definition

The number of passengers who pass through a given location in a particular direction, over a defined length of time.

It is a measurement of movement capacity, which is helpful in understanding the effectiveness of public transport infrastructure.
```
```{tab-item} Application
Metrics:
* Number of passengers per Hour
* Number of passengers per Minute

i.e. Every hour, 70 passengers boarded the southbound train through platform 1.
```

## Passenger Miles
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Definition

A metric that describes the total number of miles travelled by passengers on a public transport system over a defined period of time.

It is a measurement that helps us understand how much distance travelled is served by a public transport system, which when contrasted with car {ref}`V:VMT`, can highlight the impact a system is making by satisfying travel demand.
```
```{tab-item} Definition
Metrics:
* Discrete number (i.e. 128,000 passenger miles travelled in a month)

Passenger miles is calculated by multiplying the number of passengers by their respective distances travelled.
```

## Peak Hour Coefficient
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Definition

A metric that describes the magnitude of difference in passenger flow between one selected hour and the overall {ref}`B:BasePeriod`.
```
````

## Peak Period
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Definition

The duration of time in a day when passenger demand for public transport services is expected to surge beyond the capacity of the {ref}`B:BasePeriod`.

This is an important time period for agencies to consider when designing schedules, as it will alter labour and asset allocations.
```

## Priority Signalisation
````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Definition

A traffic engineering strategy and infrastructural program that uses sensor technology to alter the behaviour of traffic signals, giving precedence to public transport vehicles (such as buses and trains) through intersections.

Priority signalisation can improve the Operating {ref}'S:Speed's and {ref}`C:CycleTime`s of public transport services, reducing costs and enhancing the passenger experience.
