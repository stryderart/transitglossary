```{sidebar} History of GTFS
GTFS was jointly pioneered by TriMet in Portland, Oregon and Google. It served as the bedrock for agencies across the United States to host their service information online, and directly led to the development of real-time public transport information on the internet. Third-party developers have since been empowered to develop trip planning apps to improve the rider experience on public transport.
