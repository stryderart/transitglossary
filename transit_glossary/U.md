## Utilisation Rate

```{tab-item} Definition

An assessment metric that measures the degree a vehicle is being productive, along a given route and timeframe. It measures the proportion of vehicle hours that are being used to operate revenue service.

The utilisation rate helps planners assess whether a route is being cost-effective and productive, and helps identify which services could use higher frequencies to minimise idling and layover time.
