## Layover

```{tabbed} Definition
a.k.a. "Terminal"

A designated location for {ref}`T:TransitUnit`s or {ref}`V:Vehicle`s to idle in-between scheduled trips, commonly where operators break, change shifts, and where supervisors are stationed.

Where "terminal" is a more universal term across public transport {ref}`M:Mode`s, "layover" is more commonly used for bus services.
```

## Layover Time

```{tabbed} Definition
a.k.a. "Terminal Time"

The duration a {ref}`T:TransitUnit` spends at a terminal in-between consecutive scheduled trips.

This is an important factor to consider in scheduling, to ensure drivers and operators have a sufficient break in-between trips.

## Load Factor

```{tabbed} Definition
a.k.a. "α (alpha)"

The capacity utilisation rate of a public transport service.

It is used to measure the effectiveness of a public transport service, whether the supply (seats provided) is being utilised and thus is worth the cost of investment.
```

```{tabbed} Application
Metrics:
* Percentage (%)
* Ratio

The Load Factor is calculated by...

$$
\frac{Σ passenger km travelled}{Σ seat km travelled}\
$$

```
