abbrev. "QSI"

A category of metrics for assessing the quality of public transport services provided. Unlike {ref}`O:OTP`, which looks at whether {ref}`T:TransitUnit`s arrive at designated {ref}`T:Timepoint`s on time, QSIs can include a variety of other metrics such as average waiting time at an average stop or station.
