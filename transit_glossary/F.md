## Farebox Recovery
```{tabbed} Definition
The percentage of public transport operating costs that are paid for by fare revenue and/or other directly generated revenue.

This is an important metric of financial sustainability for any public transport provider, as it also inversely reveals the level of subsidisation needed to provide service. The Farebox Recovery Ratio informs fare policy decision-making, and is at the centre of such debates.
